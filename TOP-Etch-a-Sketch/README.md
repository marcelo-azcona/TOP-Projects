# Odin-Project-Etch-a-Sketch

This is DOM Manipulation project for the Odin Project Curriculum:
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project


I learned the following topics:

* Function calling.
* .forEach method for Arrays and NodeLists.
* Arrow functions.
* DOM manipulations and Events.
* Git branching and merging.
* Function refactoring. 

It took me roughly 13 hours to write the JavaScript/HTML/CSS code for this.
I struggled a little with the CSS/javaScript coordination (for styles) but in the end i figured out!
