# TOP-Library

This is a Object-Oriented Programming task for the Odin Project Curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

Through this project I learned the following topics:

* The aplication of Constructor, Prototypes and Inheritance.
* DOM traversing.
* Some advanced DOM manipulations techniques and Events.
* Code refactoring.
* The use of the BEM convention for CSS selectors.


It took me roughly 8 hours to write the JavaScript/HTML/CSS code for this. I struggled a little bit with the DOM manipulation, but I solved it in the end!
