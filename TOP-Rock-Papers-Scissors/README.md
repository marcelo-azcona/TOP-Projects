This is The Odin Projects Rock Paper Scissors project!

I learned a lot about:

* Parameters.
* Function calling.
* Defining variables.
* .forEach method for Arrays and NodeList.
* Arrow functions.
* DOM manipulations and Events.
* Git branching and merging.

It took roughly 7 hours to write the JavaScript code for this. It was very fun!.
