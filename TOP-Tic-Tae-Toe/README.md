# TOP-Tic-Tae-Toe

This a simple Tic - Tae - Toe game that I created using HTML, CSS and Javascript for the Object-Oriented Programming part of the Javascript Path of the Odin Project Curriculum. 
I learned a great deal out of this. To make this I tried to use several different tools that are available in the Javascript language to reinforce the knowledge that I have learned so far.

Technologies:
* HTML.
* CSS.
* Javascript.

Tools:
* Visual Studio Code.
* Linux terminal use (via a Virtual Machine).
* Git and GitHub.
* ESLint + Prettier.

Outcome:
* I improved my knowledge of Javascript and of the OOP concepts. 
* I learned how to plan and organized my code, saving a lot of time.
* I learned how to use the Revealing Module Pattern and how to make functions private.
* I used CSS3 grid and flexbot to make the layout.
